* [algs4-percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html) - using an implementation of the union-find algorithm to estimate the percolation threshold between
the top and bottom of a square cell
* [algs4-randomdeque](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html) - implementations of a randomized queue (pops items randomly) and a double ended queue (can push and pop
