# Assignments for Coursera's [Algorithms, Part I](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-007/) MOOC.

* algs4-percolation - using an implementation of the union-find algorithm to estimate the percolation threshold between
the top and bottom of a square cell
* algs4-randomdeque - implementations of a randomized queue (pops items randomly) and a double ended queue (can push and pop
at the front and at the back)
